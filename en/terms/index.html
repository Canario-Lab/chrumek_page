          <li>Entry - information added in the App about a "declared saving" (e.g., skipping a purchase, choosing a cheaper alternative, canceling a subscription) or other data entered by the User.</li>
          <li>Transfer / "Added to savings" - an action in the App confirming that money was actually set aside (moving entries from the "to transfer" list to history as "transferred/saved").</li>
          <li>Premium - paid access to full App functionality under a subscription.</li>
          <li>Trial - a free Premium trial period, if available to the User in the App Store.</li>

        </ol>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">

        <ol>
          <li>The App is designed to support the habit of saving by recording "temptations" and savings and by confirming that funds have actually been set aside.</li>
          <li>The App is not a financial service, is not a bank or financial advisor, does not execute transfers, and does not intermediate transactions.</li>
          <li>The Service Provider does not guarantee achieving specific savings results.</li>
        </ol>

        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>increases only after an actual Transfer is made,</li>

          <li>If the User does not want to continue the subscription after Trial, they should cancel the subscription in Apple ID account settings in accordance with Apple rules.</li>
          <li>Ending or canceling Trial does not reset the counter of used free Transfers (Section 6).</li>
