      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>1) Data Controller</h2>
        <p>The controller of personal data is:<br />Canario-Lab / Chrumek App<br />Contact e-mail: chrumek@chrumek.app</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>2) Scope and Purpose</h2>
        <p>The Chrumek app is an app for tracking savings through records of "temptations" and confirmed transfers/saved amounts.</p>
        <p>We do not operate user accounts and we do not collect data that allows us to identify you directly.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>3) Data Processed in the App (locally on the device)</h2>
        <p>Data that you enter in the app (e.g., savings entries, amounts, dates, categories, goals, settings) is stored locally on your device.</p>
        <p>It is not automatically sent to us or to our servers.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>4) Features Requiring System Access</h2>
        <p>The app may use system features and related data only to the extent necessary for operation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Notifications (UNUserNotificationCenter) - if you enable reminders, the iOS system delivers notifications according to your settings.</li>
          <li>Language / region / currency / theme - used to format app content and appearance (without sending to us).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>5) Bug Reports / Support Contact</h2>
        <p>If you use the "Report a bug" option or contact support:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the app may create an e-mail draft in your mail application,</li>
          <li>the content may include diagnostic information (e.g., app version, iOS, language/currency settings) - exactly what you see in the e-mail content before sending,</li>
          <li>sending takes place only if you approve it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A sent e-mail is processed by your mail provider and by us as the recipient, solely for handling your request.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>6) Purchases and Subscriptions (Apple + RevenueCat)</h2>
        <p>If paid features (subscriptions) are available in the app:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>payments are processed by Apple (App Store / In-App Purchases / StoreKit),</li>
          <li>the app uses RevenueCat as an infrastructure provider for subscription management (including offer presentation, subscription status verification, and granting premium access).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As part of subscription handling, technical data related to the purchase may be processed, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>transaction/purchase identifiers and product information,</li>
          <li>subscription status (active/inactive, renewals),</li>
          <li>a technical user identifier used to link subscription status (e.g., an anonymous App User ID generated by the SDK).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>RevenueCat processes this data to provide subscription handling services (as a processor), and Apple processes payment-related data in accordance with its own policies.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>7) Analytics and Tracking</h2>
        <p>The app does not use analytics tools or advertising SDKs to track users and does not sell data.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>8) Website (landing page)</h2>
        <p>If you visit our website, the hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages) may automatically process standard technical data in server logs (including IP address, browser type, date and time of request) for security, diagnostics, and service continuity purposes. The scope and rules of processing result from the hosting provider's policies.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>9) Data Recipients</h2>
        <p>Data may be disclosed only to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>payment and subscription service providers: Apple and RevenueCat (subscription handling),</li>
          <li>public authorities, if required by law.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>10) Storage Period</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Data entered in the app is stored locally until you delete it (e.g., by deleting entries or deleting the app).</li>
          <li>E-mail correspondence data is retained for as long as needed to handle the request and to defend against claims (if necessary).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>11) User Rights (EU/EEA)</h2>
        <p>If, in a given case, we process your personal data (e.g., when you send us an e-mail), you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>access, rectification, erasure, and restriction of processing,</li>
          <li>object,</li>
          <li>lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The scope of information obligations follows in particular from Article 13 GDPR.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>12) Security</h2>
        <p>We apply reasonable organizational and technical measures appropriate to the nature of the service. Since app data is stored locally, an important element of security is also protecting your device (passcode/Face ID).</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>13) Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>The policy may be updated with changes to app functions or legal requirements. The current version will be published on the app website.</p>
